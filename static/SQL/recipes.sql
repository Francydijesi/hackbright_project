(Instead of spinach, you could add chopped herbs, but plain spaetzle are divine, too.)

Assertive seasoning and the slight charring from the wok complement the peas’ sweetness wonderfully. The method works well for other spring vegetables, too, like asparagus or baby bok choy clusters. Use a wide cast -iron pan if you don’t have a wok. Take care to avoid overcooking; the peas should be a vibrant green color and firm to the bite.','VG_2.jpg','VG','American','','Delicious',6,'15 minutes','E','NYT');

Here, Moroccan seasonings mingle for a bright balance of flavors: sweetness comes from dates and onions, and heat and spice from ginger and cumin. This tagine is traditionally accompanied only by warm whole wheat pita or Arab flatbread. But, if you wish, serve with buttered couscous or even mashed potatoes. Roasted parsnips or wilted mustard greens would harmonize well, too.','','MT','Moroccan','','Delicious',6,'3 1/2 hours ','D','NYT');
